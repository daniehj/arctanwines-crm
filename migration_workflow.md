# Migration Workflow for Arctan Wines CRM

## ✅ WORKING SOLUTION: Local Testing + Existing Alembic

Since the full Alembic integration causes Pydantic dependency issues, here's the **practical workflow** that works:

### 🔧 Setup

1. **Use the existing `db-migrations` Lambda** (already has working Alembic)
2. **Test locally first** using the local testing script
3. **Deploy via AWS Lambda** for production

### 🧪 Local Testing Workflow

```bash
# 1. Test migrations locally before deployment
python local_migration_test.py test

# 2. Check current revision status
python local_migration_test.py current

# 3. View migration history
python local_migration_test.py history

# 4. Create new migration (when needed)
python local_migration_test.py create "add phase 4 models"
```

### 🚀 Production Deployment Workflow

1. **Test Locally First**: 
   ```bash
   python local_migration_test.py test
   ```
   
2. **If local test passes**, deploy via Amplify:
   ```bash
   npx ampx sandbox deploy
   ```

3. **Run production migration** via the dashboard or direct Lambda call

### 📋 Current Status

- ✅ **Local testing**: Uses SQLite for safe testing
- ✅ **Alembic monitoring**: Proper revision tracking
- ✅ **Environment separation**: Local vs Production
- ✅ **No dependency issues**: Uses existing working setup
- ✅ **Phase 3 models**: Customer, Order, OrderItem models ready

### 🔍 Migration Status Monitoring

The dashboard shows:
- **Table completion status** (missing/partial/complete)
- **Pending migrations count**
- **Manual migration as fallback**

### 💡 Why This Works

1. **Avoids Pydantic conflicts** by keeping Alembic in separate Lambda
2. **Local testing safety** with SQLite before production
3. **Uses existing working infrastructure**
4. **Provides proper migration monitoring**

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. Use `python local_migration_test.py test` before any deployment
2. The existing manual migration system remains as fallback
3. Phase 3 models are ready when you need them
4. No complex dependency management needed

This gives you **proper Alembic monitoring and local testing** without the dependency hell!
